# Example 1 / Allocation

This microservice manages product batches and allocations. So you can stock up on products and allocate / deallocate them as you need.

It's basically a copy from the book [Architecture Patterns with Python: Enabling Test-Driven Development, Domain-Driven Design, and Event-Driven Microservices](https://www.cosmicpython.com/book/preface.html).

Differences:
- [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/) is used to validate external requests / messages.
